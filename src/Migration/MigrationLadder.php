/**
 * The deterministic migration engine: a popcorn {@see StrategyLadder} of migration
 * rungs run STRONGEST-FIRST with the uniform acceptance gate, falling to a
 * QUARANTINE floor when every rung abstains.
 *
 * Ladder shape (strongest -> weakest):
 *   1. structural        — diff-driven add/drop/widen.
 *   2. declared-mapping  — x-migrate-from renames/moves.
 *   3. custom-transform  — a registered author Invocable (when a registry is set).
 *   (llm-try is NOT in the default ladder — a host inserts it explicitly.)
 *
 * Each rung self-validates against the TARGET `$id` schema (the acceptance gate)
 * and demotes when it cannot produce a conforming candidate. When the underlying
 * StrategyLadder returns null, the floor returns a {@see MigrationResult::quarantined()}
 * that preserves the ORIGINAL payload immutably — the source is never mutated or
 * destroyed.
