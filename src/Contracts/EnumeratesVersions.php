 * the trailing version segment).
 *
 * This is an ownership-AGNOSTIC enumeration only — it answers "which version
 * integers exist for this stem?" and nothing more. All version-selection policy
 * (what "latest" means, system-vs-tenant precedence) lives in the host above the
 * registry, not here; the package stays exact-`$id` keyed and policy-free.
 *
 * An unknown stem returns an empty array — never an exception — so "does any
 * version of this stem exist?" is a cheap, total query.
