/**
 * Opt-in marker for schema lifecycle (slice 12).

 * A {@see Data} class that implements this interface opts
 * into versioned, absolutely-addressable schemas:
 *
 *  - the generator emits a real absolute versioned `$id`
 *    (`<base>/<schemaName>/<schemaVersion>`), carrying the version natively in
 *    `$id` rather than a bespoke attribute or the `$schema` dialect field;
 *  - when such a class is nested inside another schema it projects its OWN
 *    absolute versioned `$id` and is referenced via `$ref: <absolute-$id>`
 *    (a JSON Schema 2020-12 bundled resource) instead of `#/$defs/Short`.
 *
 * A class that does NOT implement this interface is completely unchanged:
 * short-name `$id`, `#/$defs/Short` inlining for nested Data classes. This is
 * the backward-compatibility seam — versioning is strictly opt-in.
